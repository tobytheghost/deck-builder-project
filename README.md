# Deck Builder Project

*This is a new version of the prototype build here: https://github.com/tobytheghost/deck-checker
This is currently a work in progress so many of the features in the prototype have not yet been implemented here.*

This project is an NX Monorepo containing two sites:
- The front facing website built using Typescript and NextJs
- The Deck Builder app built using Typescript and React

The two sites share a single UI lib folder.
